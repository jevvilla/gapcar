# GAPCAR

React.js solution for GAP challenge "Vitrina de vehiculos".

## Before we start

Please make sure you have `node`, `npm`, `git` installed correctly. In case you don't have any of those installed and setup, please go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install the **Recommended For Most Users** version. Go [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download `git`.

Once you have installed and setup everything suggested above, you can go ahead and clone this repo using the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jevvilla/gapcar.git
```

#### ⚠️ Please make sure you are in the correct branch, `dev` in this case.

Then go to the project root (project folder `"gapcar"`), and run the following commands to get the app running:

- `git checkout dev` to be placed in the correct branch.
- `npm install` - Install project dependencies.
- `npm run start` - Run the app locally. By default this will run in your favorite browser.

if you follow all steps above correctly, now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Enjoy.
